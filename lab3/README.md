# You Spin Me Round Robin

This program simulates Round Robin CPU scheduling. You give it a list of processes and a time quantum, and it tells you the average wait time and response time. 

## Building
```
make
```


## Running

cmd for running TODO
```shell
./rr processes.txt 3
```
Expected Output: Average waiting time: 7.00
                 Average response time: 2.75

results TODO
```shell
Average waiting time: 7.00
Average response time: 2.75
```

## Cleaning up

```shell
make clean
```
